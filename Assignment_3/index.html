                    <p>With my family, I reached Delhi by train. After some rest, we undertook a visit to Delhi. Delhi is a historical city. It has been called by different names in different periods of time. On one hand there are Red Fort, Jama Masjid, Jantar Mantar, Qutub Minar, India Gate which narrate the glorious past of India; while Rashtrapati Bhawan, Lotus Temple, Parliament, to name a few, are the wonders of modern times.</p>
                    <p>We visited the Red Fort first. The Red Fort is also known as Lal Quila and is the landmark of Delhi. It stands on the bank of river Yamuna. It was built by Shah Jehan in 1648. It is built using red stones. It consisted of Diwan-e-Aam, Diwan-e-Khas, Rang Mahal etc. The surroundings of the pavilion have been decorated using precious stones, gems, valuable stones and silver linings.</p>
                    <p>Diwan-e-Khas is beautifully designed and has its walls engraved with following text: "If there is anywhere Paradise on earth, it is this, it is this and it is this". Another superb structure like Pearl Mosque on Moti Masjid is built near Rang Mahal. Then we went to the first floor. On the first floor there is a war memorial museum.</p>

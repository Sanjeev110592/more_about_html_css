            <p>Of the standard fonts used in essays and other documents, Verdana will create the most pages. On average, Verdana will create 1.1 pages for every 1 page written using Arial and 0.9 pages for every page written with Times New Roman or Calibri in Microsoft Word or Google Docs. These are just estimates . If you're looking to write the fewest number of words for your school assignment to meet a page count, we recommend using Verdana (if allowed) or Arial. A good rule of thumb is to use Arial font unless your teacher provides different guidelines for font or spacing.</p>

            <h2>About global worming</h2>
            <p>One of the major steps we could take forward is to use renewable sources of energy. To run our home equipment we need to use the Solar panels. The government also needs to find ways to use the green energy of electricity production through Windmill, Solar panels, etc. We need to use public transport as much as possible. It will reduce the consumption of fuels and thus reduce greenhouse gases. Cycles can also be used for traveling a small distance. We know that while operating, refrigerators and air conditioners release ChloroFluoroCarbons(CFC). When released to the atmosphere they go and react with the ozone and creating a hole in the ozone layer. Through this hole, humans are now exposed to the ultraviolet rays which comes with the sunlight.</p>
            <p>Humans can’t protect themselves from these rays and it can cause skin cancer. So, we need to use this equipment as less as possible or the manufacturers need to make the necessary changes and make this equipment environment friendly. Plastics are also a very big problem for the environment as they are non-biodegradable. They are creating water and land pollution. We can’t dispose of them so we burn them and which release more lethal gases. Sometimes we also burn leaves and biodegradable waste which also causes pollution. So, we need to stop doing that and instead create a better waste management system. We need to change our behavior and lifestyle to protect and preserve our planet.</p>
            <p>As far as Global Warming is concerned all governments of the world are also taking steps to reduce the emission of greenhouse gases. Countries around the world have recognised this problem and signed a pact in Paris called The Paris Agreement in 2015. They all pledged to reduce their carbon footprints. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), has set a target of not increasing the temperature more than around 2 degrees Celcius and in the later years around 1.5 degrees.Although everything is not going very well with this agreement. Recently, Donald Trump – president of the United Nations of America pulled out of this agreement citing that developing nations are not doing enough to control their Carbon emission and all the money is going in vain. On the other hand, developing nations like China have argued that the developed nations like the United States of America have already developed their nations while polluting the planet. But, it’s now their turn to develop their country and they are doing their bit to curb the carbon emissions.</p>
